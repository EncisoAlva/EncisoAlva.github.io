My name is Julio Cesar Enciso-Alva, but y'all can call me just Julio. I enjoy stories.

Please don't call me _Prof. Alva_; use instead _Prof. Enciso_ or _Prof. Enciso-Alva_. 
This is due to the naming tradition in Mexico: the first family name comes from the father (Nicolas Enciso-Maturano) and the 
second family name comes from the mother (Maria Guadalupe Alva-Gonzalez).

I also have a brother, Erick Ricardo Enciso-Alva. Here is a family picture of us :)

I was born on the [Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca), in Central Mexico, and spent my first years there.
I ate burritos for the first when I arrived to the US, and I don't celebrate May 5.

Hopefully I made a good job convincing you that I am human.
Outside of work I often listen to music, play board games, read and write, cook, and collect curious trinkets.
Fun findings from my hobbies:

* Urban rock, based on the early punk, is music about life in big cities from Latin America. Listen to [my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6n2246dw0TA2m6GvpSwbXc?si=2a58573913bb4266) about it.
* There is an 'Oscar' for board games. It is called [Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/games/) (Game of the Year). If we played a game before, it is very likely one of nominees.
* Mexican rice is theorized to be a variation of Jollof rice. Cooking  mexican rice properly is considered a requisite for staring a household in some rural areas.



**PD:** I don't hate students, even if they aren't doing fine in my classes. Although I may be not very expressive, I am proud of y'alls effort.
