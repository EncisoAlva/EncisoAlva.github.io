My name is Julio Cesar Enciso-Alva, but y'all can call me just Julio. I enjoy stories.

Please don't call me _Prof. Alva_; use instead _Prof. Enciso_ or _Prof. Enciso-Alva_. 
This is due to the naming tradition in Mexico: the first family name comes from the father (Nicolas Enciso-Maturano) and the 
second family name comes from the mother (Maria Guadalupe Alva-Gonzalez).

I also have a brother, Erick Ricardo Enciso-Alva. Here is a family picture of us :)

I was born on the [Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca), in Central Mexico, and spent my first years there.
I ate burritos for the first when I arrived to the US, and I don't celebrate May 5.

Hopefully I made a good job convincing you that I am human.
Outside of work I often listen to music, play board games, read and write, cook, and collect curious trinkets.
Fun findings from my hobbies:

* Urban rock, based on the early punk, is music about life in big cities from Latin America. Listen to [my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6n2246dw0TA2m6GvpSwbXc?si=2a58573913bb4266) about it.
* There is an 'Oscar' for board games. It is called [Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/games/) (Game of the Year). If we played a game before, it is very likely one of nominees.
* Mexican rice is theorized to be a variation of Jollof rice. Cooking  mexican rice properly is considered a requisite for staring a household in some rural areas.

By the way, if you are courius about the tiny blue/red symbol used as icon, it is from a DC comics cartoon.
To be more specific it is from Young Justice 4th season; any further details are clearly spoilers.

_Some context on the power rings._ While Green Lanterns Corps gather power from willpower, other emotions are also actively used for the same purpose. 
Blue rings use hope, red rings use rage, yellow rings use fear, orange rings use greed, etc.
I like to think of the blue/red combination as **perserverance**, and it is a nice goal.



**PD:** I don't hate students, even if they aren't doing fine in my classes. Although I may be not very expressive, I am proud of y'alls effort.
