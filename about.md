My name is Julio Cesar Enciso-Alva, but y'all can call me Julio.

Please don't call me _Prof. Alva_; use instead _Prof. Enciso_ or _Prof. Enciso-Alva_. 

If you're curious, my long name follows the custom from Mexico: the first family name comes from the father (Nicolas Enciso-Maturano) and the second family name comes from the mother (Maria Guadalupe Alva-Gonzalez).

I also have a brother, Erick Ricardo Enciso-Alva. Here is a family picture of us :)

I was born in Central Mexico, specifically in [Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca). I spent most of my early life there until I completed college.
