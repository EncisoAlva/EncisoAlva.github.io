Welcome to my personal website!

Good morning/day/evening y'all !! 

This is my personal website, still under construction. If you ask me 'where I learnt how to do websites?' then the answer is: right now, I'm still learning. 

**I’m on the 2024 academic job market.**

For some look at my work, please visit either my [GitHub](https://github.com/EncisoAlva), my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8315-6849) page, or my [Google Sholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qqw6kegAAAAJ) page.

## Research

Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) is a family of methods for estimating the location of neural electrical sources inside the brain, based on recordings from electrodes located either at the scalp (EEG), brain cortex (ECoG), or stylets inside the brain (SEEG). Applications of ESI include non-invasive detection of epileptogenic zones.  

Electrode recordings are known to have a high resolution in time and a poor resolution in space, and ESI inherits these characteristics. The inclusion of additional modalities of data, such as fMRI, could be integrated in the ESI formulation to increase its resolution, speed, and robustness to noise. 

Novel applications of ESI include Virtual Electrodes (VEs): estimates for recordings from inserted electrodes which are computed from ESI data. VEs are relatively inexpensive and non-intrusive in comparison with inserted electrodes, and their characteristics and limitations are similar as the data modalities they're based on.  

My current research is focused on generating better multi-modal ESI methods, optimized for clinical applications and its requirements –better resolution, more robustness to noise, improved speed, etc.  

Past research projects are listed below:
* Novel ESI methods with regional Bayesian priors, with applications to Virtual Electrodes. 
* Evaluation of fMRI-informed EEG-based ESI techniques. 
* Validation of ESI techniques from ECoG data in a pig model. 
* ESI from EEG during epilepsy on infants. 

## About me

I am a man of few words. Born in the beautiful and windy city of Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo, Mexico. My name is long but I refuse to abbreviate: Enciso comes from my father, Alva comes from my mother. 

Fascinated by science fiction, I decided to become a scientist myself. I studied Applied Math and Biology at the Autonomous University of Hidalgo State, then at the University of Texas at Arlington.
