Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) is a technique used to identify neural sources of electrical activity inside the brain, which may be related to normal or pathological states, given recordings of surface electric potentials like [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography). 
Applications of ESI include Neuropsychology and non-invasive monitoring of Epileptogenesis, among others.
