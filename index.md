My main research is in Inverse Problems and Mathematical Data Science via Convex Optimization, with applications to Computational Neuroscience and Imaging. 
For more details, visit the [Research tab](https://encisoalva.github.io/research/).

In a few words, I develop methods for better and cheaper imaging. I also use somewhat fancy statistics.

**Iâ€™m in the 2025-2026 job market.**
