This part is under constant updates. I'm more a fan of visual than of words. Please check [these slides](/files/EncisoAlva_240226.pdf?raw=true) about my research, they were planned for a 3 minutes presentation.

Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) is a technique used to identify neural sources of electrical activity inside the brain, which may be related to normal or pathological states, given recordings of surface electric potentials like [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)). 
Applications of ESI include Neuropsychology and non-invasive monitoring of Epileptogenesis, among others.

The mathematical formulation of this task includes solving the system 

$$ \mathbf{G}\, {\color{red} \mathbf{S}} + \varepsilon = \mathbf{Y} $$

for ${\color{red} \mathbf{S}}$, given $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ an $m\times n$ matrix with $m\ll n$.
