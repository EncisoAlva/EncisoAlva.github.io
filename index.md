Welcome to my personal website, still under construction. If you ask me 'where I learnt how to do websites?' then the answer is: right now, I'm still learning. 

I am an Applied Mathematician specialized in solving Inverse Problems via Convex Optimization; applications include Source Localisation and Virtual Electrodes from MEG/EEG data. 

If you'd like something ~more specific~, go to the `Research tab`. If you'd like something *less specfic*, I make theory for better and cheaper imaging methods.

**Iâ€™m on the 2024 academic job market.**
