I am a PhD candidate Applied Mathematician at the University o Texas at Arlington.

My research is about Inverse Problems via Convex Optimization with applications to Source Localisation and Virtual Electrodes from MEG/EEG data. 
For  more details, please go to the `Research` tab; but
if you'd like something _less_ specfic, then I make math theory for better and cheaper imaging methods.

**Iâ€™m on the 2024 academic job market.**
