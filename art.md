As a hobby, I have been making figures that can be described as [cycloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid) over [Bézier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) or as [spirograph curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) over Bézier curves.
A great collection of those figures can be found on my Instagram page, [BézierSpirographsEveryDay](https://www.instagram.com/Bézierspirographseveryday?igsh=MWR2NXBtcGdhNWxyNg==).

Aside from being visually pleasing, there is beauty in how these figures generalize the concept of cycloids.

I keep the code to produce those animations at [this](https://github.com/EncisoAlva/spirographs_matlab) public GitHub repository. After learning the basic principles, however, the interested reader may find a more efficient way to implement them. 

# Cycloids, epicycloids, hypercycloids, and their cusps

Consider a circle $\mathcal{W}$ with center at $\mathbf{Z}_\mathcal{W}$ and radius $R_\mathcal{W}$. The circle $\mathcal{W}$ is *rolling* over a line $R_\mathcal{L}$. A **cycloid** can be described as the curves generated by a point $\mathbf{M}$ located at the circumference of $\mathcal{W}$. 

![Construction of a cycloid.](https://github.com/EncisoAlva/EncisoAlva.github.io/blob/main/img/art/fig02.png?raw=true)

Consider now a similar construction replacing $\mathcal{L}$ with a circle $\mathcal{C}$, with center $\mathbf{Z}_\mathcal{C}$ and radius $R_\mathcal{C}$.
An **epicycloid** is the curve generated by $\mathbf{M}$.

If the ratio $k = R_\mathcal{C}/R_\mathcal{W}$ is an integer, then the epicycloid has exactly $k$ *cusps*.

![Epicycloids with integer ratios.](https://github.com/EncisoAlva/EncisoAlva.github.io/blob/main/img/art/fig03.png?raw=true)

If the ratio $k = R_\mathcal{W}/R_\mathcal{C}$ is rational, then the number of cusps will be $\tau$, the smallest integer so that $\tau/k$ is an integer. The curve will self-intersect, leading to a grid-like pattern.

![Epicycloids with rational ratios.](https://github.com/EncisoAlva/EncisoAlva.github.io/blob/main/img/art/fig04.png?raw=true)

If the ratio $k = R_\mathcal{W}/R_\mathcal{C}$ is irrational, then the epicycloid should be dense in a circular donut; the center will be the same as $\mathcal{C}$, the inner radius $R_\mathcal{C}$, and the outer radius $R_\mathcal{C} + 2 R_\mathcal{W} = (1+2k) R_\mathcal{C}$. This case is not very visually pleasing.

*Spoiler:* All these observations about cusps are conserved if the circle $\mathcal{C}$ is replaced by $\mathcal{B}$, an arbitrary once-differentiable closed curve of finite length.
Although we shall use instead the ratio between perimeters $k = P_\mathcal{W}/P_\mathcal{B}$.

![Generalized epicycloids with rationl ratios.](https://github.com/EncisoAlva/EncisoAlva.github.io/blob/main/img/art/fig05.png?raw=true)

**Hypercycloids** can be defined in a similar way to epicycloids. The only difference is that the circle $\mathcal{W}$ will be inside $\mathcal{C}$, not outside. All the theoretical considerations about cusps are equally valid for hypercycloids.

## Parametrization of cycloids and other trochoids

Maybe the simplest way to parametrize a cycloid is in terms of $\theta$, the angular displacement of $\mathcal{W}$. Recall that $\mathcal{W}$ has center $\mathbf{Z}_\mathcal{W}$ and radius $\mathcal{W}$ is $R_\mathcal{M}$, and let $R_\mathcal{M}$ be the distance from $\mathbf{M}$ to $\mathbf{Z}_\mathcal{W}$.

$$
\mathbf{M}(\theta) = 
\begin{bmatrix} u(\theta) \\ v(\theta) \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} R_\mathcal{W} \theta - R_\mathcal{M}\sin (\theta) \\ R_\mathcal{W} - R_\mathcal{M} \cos (\theta) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The reason to introduce $R_\mathcal{M}$ is to allow cases when $R_\mathcal{M} \neq R_\mathcal{W}$.
If $R_\mathcal{M} < R_\mathcal{W}$, the resulting curve is known as a **curtate cycloid**. If $R_\mathcal{M} > R_\mathcal{W}$, the resulting curve is known as a **prolate cycloid**.

(Fig 7)

The term **trochoids** refers to all cycloids, curtate cycloids, and prolate cycloids. The adjectives 'prolate' and 'curtate' can be applied to epi- and hypercycloids by considering $R_\mathcal{M}$on a similar way.

# Bézier curves and their tangent vector

Bézier curves are parametric curves. Their general definition can be found elsewhere, like in their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). I want to emphasize the case of cubic Bézier curves in the plane. Given the points $\mathbf{P}_0, \mathbf{P}_1, \mathbf{P}_2, \mathbf{P}_3$ and a parameter $t \in [0,1]$, the cubic Bézier curve is the collection of points $\mathbf{P}(t)$ given by

$$
\mathbf{B}(t) = (1-t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3(1-t)^2t \mathbf{P}_1 + 3(1-t) t^2 \mathbf{P}_2 + t^3 \mathbf{P}_3
$$

(Fig?)

Although many things can be said about Bézier curves, I want to emphasize their role on graphic design. The concatenation of multiple cubic Bézier curves, which is called a path, is versatile enough to be used for general-purpose vector graphics. Standard formats such as SVG and EPS use cubic Bézier curves to encode complex general shapes.

Cubic Bézier curves are so common within the graphic design community. They are intuitive to generate and interpret, and have a simple formulation. Thus, they are a good way to encode general shapes and construct cycloids over them.

# Cycloids over a Bézier curve

Maybe the most straightforward way to attack this task is by generating a local coordinate system near the curve. An unit tangent vector $T(t)$ can be computed with relative ease.

$$
\mathbf{T}(t) = rotate \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{B}(t)}{\Vert \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{B}(t) \Vert}
$$

Notice that an analytic expression of $T(t)$ is quite challenging, yet it is easy to compute for any given $t$. If the curve is smooth enough, which is often the case, then $(B(t),T(t))$ is good enough to construct a map from the plane. 

Recall that the coordinates of the cycloid, parameterized by $\theta$, are given by

$$ \begin{aligned}
u(\theta) &= R_\mathcal{W} \theta - \sin (\theta) \\v(\theta) &= R_\mathcal{W} - \cos (\theta) 
\end{aligned}$$

Although it is tempting to map $\theta$ into $B(t)$, we shall consider that $B(t)$ does not necessarily go over its trace at constant speed. In other words, we can measure the traversed path of $B(t)$ from $0$ to $t$ as follows

$$
A(t) = \int_0^t \sqrt{ \left( \frac{d}{ds} B_x(s) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{d}{ds} B_y(s) \right)^2 } ds
$$
where $B_x(t)$ and $B_y(t)$ are the $x,y$ coordinates of $B(t)$, respectively. 

The function $A(t)$ is not necessarily linear, yet it needs to be accounted for when mapping $\theta$ into $B(t)$.
The simplest way to write the coordinates after mapping will be given by
$$ [x,y]^T = 
B\left( u\left(A^{-1}\left(\theta\right)\right)\right) + v\left(A^{-1}\left(\theta\right)\right) T\left( u\left(A^{-1}\left(\theta\right)\right)\right)
$$

In general, the function $A$ may not have a simple closed-form; however, it can be approximated with relative ease. 
Similarly, $A^{-1}$ will be troublesome to write analytically. 

The use of $A^{-1}$ can be avoided by using the following strategy:
1. Generate a collection of values $t \in [0,1]$.
2. Compute $\theta(t) = A(t)$.
3. Compute $u(t)= R_\mathcal{W} \theta(t) - \sin (\theta(t))$, $v(t) = R_\mathcal{W} - \cos (\theta(t))$.
4. Compute $[x(t), y(t)]^T = B\left( u\left(t\right)\right) + v\left(t\right) T\left( u\left(t\right)\right)$.

# Discussion

The construction of generalized epi- and hypercycloids over general curves brings implies a collection of physical constraints that are unnacounted for. If a physically feasible construction is desired, they can be identified and removed manually.

When constructing generalized hypercycloids using a curve $\mathcal{B}$, a **return effect** is generated when the curvature of $\mathcal{B}$ is smaller than the curvature of $\mathcal{W}$. This behavior is not physically feasible. This condition represents the case when $\mathcal{W}$ *doesn't fit* in a section of $\mathcal{B}$.

# Future work

Words more, words less. The algorithm can be easily generalized for other rolling shapes. Just change the parametrization for $(u,v)$. But general shapes will bring new sets of physical constraints that need to be incorporated to the model.
