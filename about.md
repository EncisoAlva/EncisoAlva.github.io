title: About me
---

I am a man of few words. Born in the beautiful and windy city of Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo, Mexico. My name is long but I refuse to abbreviate: Enciso comes from my father, Alva comes from my mother. 

Fascinated by science fiction, I decided to become a scientist myself. I studied Applied Math and Biology at the Autonomous University of Hidalgo State, then at the University of Texas at Arlington.
