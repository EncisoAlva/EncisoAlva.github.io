Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) is a technique used to identify neural sources of electrical activity inside the brain, which may be related to normal or pathological states, given recordings of surface electric potentials like [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)). 
Applications of ESI include Neuropsychology and non-invasive monitoring of Epileptogenesis, among others.

The mathematical formulation of this task includes solving the system 
$$ \mathbf{G}\, {\color{red} \mathbf{S}} + \varepsilon = \mathbf{Y} $$
for ${\color{red} \mathbf{S}}$, given $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ an $m\times n$ matrix with $m\ll n$.
