Currently, I am a PhD candidate Applied Mathematician at the University o Texas at Arlington.

My main research is Inverse Problems and Mathematical Data Science via Convex Optimization, with applications to Computational Neuroscience and Imaging. 
For  more details go to the [Research tab](research.md).

On a few words, I make methods for better and cheaper imaging, and I also do funky statistics.

**Iâ€™m on the 2024 academic job market.**
