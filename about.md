Born in Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo, Mexico. My name I refuse to abbreviate: Enciso from my father and Alva from my mother, as it was the custom where I was born. 

Despite being kinda' autistic, I display regular human behaviour on numerous occassions. Outside work I often listen to music, play board games, read and write, or cook.

Fun findings from my hobbies:

* Urban rock, based on the early punk, is music about life in big cities from Latin America. Listen to [my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6n2246dw0TA2m6GvpSwbXc?si=2a58573913bb4266) about it.
* There is an 'Oscar' for board games. It is called [Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/games/) (Game of the Year). If we played a game before, it is very likely one of nominees.
* Mexican rice is theorized to be a variation of Jollof rice. Cooking  mexican rice properly is considered a requisite for staring a household in some rural areas.
