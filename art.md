As a hobby I have been making figures that can be described as [epicycloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycloid) over [Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve), or also as [spirograph curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) over Bezier curves.
A great collection of those can be found on my Instagram page [BezierSpirographsEveryDay](https://www.instagram.com/bezierspirographseveryday?igsh=MWR2NXBtcGdhNWxyNg==).

I keep the code that produces those animations at a public GitHub repository, available in [this link](https://github.com/EncisoAlva/spirographs_matlab). After reading the basic principles, the interested reader may find a more efficient way to implement them. 

Aside from being visually pleasing, these figures are beautiful because they generalize the concept of cycloids.
Many properties of classic cycloids, like the astounding looks, are translated verbatim. 
Other properties, like the simple formulation, are more elusive.

Classical epicycloids can be described as curves generated by a point $P$, located in a circle $\mathcal{W}$ of radius $R_\mathcal{W}$, which changes position as $\mathcal{W}$ rotates over a circle $\mathcal{C}$ of radius $R_\mathcal{W}$. For an epicycloid, $\mathcal{W}$ must be outside of $\mathcal{C}$.

One thing we can observe is that if the ratio $k = R_\mathcal{W}/R_\mathcal{C}$ is an integer, then we obtain a figure with exactly $k$ **petals**.

(Fig 1)

The case when $k = R_\mathcal{W}/R_\mathcal{C} = a/b$ is a rational number becomes a bit more complicated. The number of petals will be $a*\beta$, where $\beta$ is the smallest integer such that $a \beta = 0 $ mod $b$. Also, the petals will intersect.

(Fig 3)

As a spoiler, this quality is conserved when replacing the circle $\mathcal{W}$ with a closed smooth curve $\mathcal{B}$. The number and distribution of petals is determined by the ratio between perimeters $k= perim\left(\mathcal{W}\right) = perim\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$.

(Fig 2)

A similar condition holds for classical hypercycloids, which are defined similarly but using $\mathcal{W}$ inside $\mathcal{C}$.
