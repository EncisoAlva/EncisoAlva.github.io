My name is Julio Cesar Enciso-Alva, but y'all can call me just Julio. I enjoy stories.

Please don't call me _Prof. Alva_; use instead _Prof. Enciso_ or _Prof. Enciso-Alva_. 
This is due to the naming tradition in Mexico: the first family name comes from the father (Nicolas Enciso-Maturano) and the 
second family name comes from the mother (Maria Guadalupe Alva-Gonzalez).

I also have a brother, Erick Ricardo Enciso-Alva. Here is a family picture of us :)

I was born in Central Mexico, specifically in [Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca). I spent most of my early life there until I completed college.
I ate burritos for the first when I arrived in the US, and I don't celebrate May 5.

Hopefully, I did a good job convincing you that I am human.
Outside work, I often listen to music, play board games, read and write, cook, and collect curious trinkets.
Fun findings from my hobbies:

* Urban rock, based on early punk, is music about life in big cities in Latin America. Listen to [my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6n2246dw0TA2m6GvpSwbXc?si=2a58573913bb4266) about it.
* There is an 'Oscar' for board games. It is called [Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/games/) (Game of the Year). If we played a game before, it is likely one of the nominees.
* Mexican rice is theorized to be a variation of Jollof rice. Cooking Mexican rice properly is considered a requisite for starting a household in some rural areas.
